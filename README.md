# Potential Buffer Overflow in Assembly Code
This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a sample assembly code snippet.  The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking on an array index.

## Vulnerability Details
The `mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx]` instruction accesses memory using a calculated address. The `ecx` register determines the array index, but if `ecx` is too large, it can lead to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting crucial data.

## Solution
The solution involves adding bounds checking to ensure that `ecx` does not exceed the valid index range of the array.
